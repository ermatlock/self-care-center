# Self Care Center: Solo Project
## Project Overview
Self Care Center is a self-guided solo project as part of the Turing Mod 1 Front-End coding program.

My goal was to create a affirmation/mantra generator, with the following functionality:
- Match original comp visual spec.
- Generate a random affirmation or mantra using existing and updatable arrays.
- Receive Message button is greyed out and unavailable until affirmation or mantra radio buttons are selected.
- Upon click of "Receive Message" button, a brief loader replaces the Buddha icon and the text fades in.
- Upon receiving the message, the user is given a "CLEAR" button in order to clear the message. Upon doing so the button and message are replaced with the Buddha icon using a fade transition.
- Site is scalable for a number of screen ratios and resolutions.

After selecting one of the two options, click on the "receive message button" to receive your randomized message. There will be a brief loader followed by the message. You can click as many times as you like to choose another randomized message.

### Clear message
If you wish you can also clear the message with the "clear button". The text will disappear and be replaced by the Buddha icon. May your message bring you good health!
