# Self Care Center: Solo Project
## Project Overview
Self Care Center is a self-guided solo project as part of the Turing Mod 1 Front-End coding program.

My goal was to create a affirmation/mantra generator, with the following functionality:
- Generate a random affirmation or mantra using existing and updatable arrays.
- Receive Message button is greyed out and unavailable until affirmation or mantra radio buttons are selected.
- Upon receiving the message, the user is given a "CLEAR" button in order to clear the message. Upon doing so the button and message are replaced with the Buddha icon.
- Site is scalable for a number of screen ratios and resolutions.
